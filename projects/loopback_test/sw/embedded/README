"How to build the embedded software?" You may ask. There are two ways.

Method 1: GUI flow
1. Export the platform specific files from XPS (HW) project by clicking Project -> Export to SDK
   Use "Export only"
2. Open Xilinx SDK, select the workspace at SDK_Workspace
3. In the Xilinx SDK GUI, click Xilinx Tools -> Repository and point the local/global repository to netfpga-10g/lib/sw/
4. Import all projects under SDK_Workspace into your workspace by clicking File -> Import -> General -> Existing projects
   do this for hw, bsp, and hello_world_0

That's it!
Now you can build your project with standard Eclipse IDE :)

Method 2: CLI flow
0. Before doing anything, please add the following directory into your $PATH
   $(XILINX_EDK)/gnu/microblaze/{Your OS}/bin/
1. Type "make" and find download.bit at result/
